Here are the author's perspectives on understanding concepts like big data, machine learning, and deep learning.

## Why Big Data?

Because the deep model architecture can memorize a big amount of complicated data (e.g. images, sounds, natural language) in an efficient way. Therefore, a machine can have much more experience than a human can ever bear. For example, an AI robot can have 180 years of human gaming experience in a day, which is why it can beat human champions. Here I will present my insights into the field of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

AI is a very broad and general concept that explains itself: let the machine have human intelligence. However, this term has been heavily abused. Most current AI systems are more machine learning systems, which essentially **overfitting data distributions**; they simply abstractly memorize data in human-designed ways (i.e., model prior). Although today's AI systems are very useful, they do not have any human intelligence (noAGI).

## What is machine learning

All we need to understand is the word "learning", which means **statistical estimation**. However, the number of parameters may be huge and we are not able to estimate them by hand. We need machines to do the calculations for us, which leads to the term machine learning. To sum up, machine learning is applied statistics with more emphasis on **statistical estimation** and trivializes **statistical inference**.

## What is deep learning

The increasing digitalization (sensors) of society produced a huge amount of complicated data, which makes the machine learning problems more and more complicated. The number of parameters needs to be huge to model these complicated data (i.e., monster model), but the most advanced machines cannot complete these statistical estimations in a reasonable time. To avoid getting a model in 10 years, we need a more efficient way to extract the key concepts (disentangled representation) from these data (entangled representation). Therefore, we need **deep architectures** which can reduce the computation burden at a log scale. This statistical reason is why deep learning can take advantage of "Big Data". To sum up, deep learning is machine learning that has superior statistical efficiency so it can encode very general beliefs of the data.
