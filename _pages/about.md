I am engaged in gaining **wide and deep** knowledge of the cutting edge AI methods and find the AI solutions to real-world problems, especially in agricultural scenarios. 


## Why we have this "Big Data" revolution?



Because the deep model architechture can memorize a big amount of the complicated data (e.g. images, sounds, natural lauguage) in an efficient way. Therefore, a machine can have much more experience than a human can ever bear. For example, an AI robot can have 180 years of human gaming experience in a day, which is why it can beat the humans champions. Here I will present my insights into the field of AI, machine learning, and deep learning. 


- **What is AI?**

AI is a very broad and general concept that explains itself: let the machine have human intelligence. However, this term has been heavily abused probably because it makes things sound fancier. However, today's AI systems are more machine learning systems that do not have any real intelligence.

- **What is machine learning?** 

All you need to understand is the word "learning", which means **statistical estimation**. However, the number of paramters may be huge and we are not able to estimate them by hand. We need machines to do the calculations for us, which leads to the term machine learning. To sum up, machine learing is applied statistics with more emphasis on statistical estimation.

- **What is deep learning?** 

The increasing digitalization (sensors) of society procduce a huge amount of complicated data, which makes the machine learning problems more and more complicated. The number of paramters need to be huge to model these complicated data (e.g. satellite images), but the most advanced machines cannot complete these statistical estimations in a reasonable time. To avoid getting a model in 10 years, we need more efficient way to extract the key concepts (disentangled representation) from these data (entangled representation). Therefore, we need **deep architectures** which can reduce the computation burdern at a log scale. This statisitical reason is why deep learning can take advantage of the "Big Data". To sum up, deep learning is machine learning that have superior statistical efficiency so it can encodes very general belief of the data. 


## My Background

<figure style="width: 36%" class="align-right">

</figure> 

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the agricultural and biological engineering department at the University of Florida major in machine learning. I had two master's degrees in quantitative genetics and statistics. I enjoy reading machine learning books and learning different machine learning areas in my spare time. I finished more than 10 books and several online courses during my Ph.D. program, so I have the foundamental knowledges across many machine learning areas, including *computer vision, natural lauguege processing, graph neural network, ensemble methods, kernel machines, bayesian deep learning, generative model (e.g. GAN, VAE, EBM, diffusion probabilistic models), reinforcement learning, causal inference and meta-learning.* However, textbooks are not enough because the field of AI is developing faster than ever; new methods can become outdated in a few months. Hence, I never stop catching up with the latest papers published in the top AI conferences. I find most of these papers can be well summarized in few sentences so I create this [60s-Paper](/portfolio/) module to help people get the principles of these papers fast. My solid statistical training enabled me to gain a deep understanding of why and how machine learning models work so I can correctly deploy AI solutions to various scenarios (see my [Projects](/projects/)).

Besides machine learning, I am passionate about real-world agricultural problems because it aims to solve basic human needs. Therefore, I am committed to contributing to the AI revolution of agricultural systems. My vision is to digitize agricultural problems and solve them with AI techniques. The AI revolution is an inevitable worldwide trend. However, the field of agriculture has not fully benefited from AI so far. Current agricultural AI applications are mostly classical statistical and machine learning decision-makers and other AI techniques, such as image recognition, that replace simple human labor. AI can do much more than that; AI is a general idea that formulates real-world problems to numerical representation that computers can process. My research's long-term goal is to use statistical AI techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, and their Bayesian version, to help with the decision support systems and other agriculture featured problems. 

I am looking for acedemy job opportunities where I can keep learning the cutting eadge techniques and deliver AI solutions to the argricalural problems. My goal is to boost the efficiency of agricultural systems with machine learning techniques. Therefore, those who spent their entire life fighting for a basic living will have the energy to explore their potential and make the world a better place. Feel free to [contact me](mailto: joshuahane@gmail.com) if you think I am suitable for your position. 


## My Research Interests

-**Machine learning techinques**: Uncertainty quantification, Bayesian deep learning, ensemble learning, zero-inflated modeling, anomally detection, generative models, computer vision (satellite image collections), and deploy these methods to argricultural problems.

-**Argricultural issues**: I have experiences in water resource, sensor data, precipitation, animal behavior and quantitative genetic issues. 

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note:** Although I have hands on these issues only, the machine learning algorithms behind can easily translate to other domains as long as the problems are clearly set up.
