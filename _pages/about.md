I am engaged in gaining **wide and deep** knowledge of the cutting edge ML methods, connect those dots, and deliver precise data science solutions to real-world problems.

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Wide:** familiar with ML algorithms across a wide range of domains.
  {: .notice--info}

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Deep:** high level understanding of the statistical principiles behind ML algorithms.

<!--- especially in agricultural scenarios. --->

<!---The field of agriculture has not fully benefited from AI so far. Currently, most agricultural AI applications are using machine learning (ML) techniques as **Maslow's hammer**;  they formulate the agricultural problems into the form that existing ML methods can process rather than design ML algorithms for specific argricultural problems. However, just like the CNN is developed for computer vision, the GNN is developed for social networks, the transformer is developed for NLP, and etc., we have limited methods that are designed specifically for particular agricultural problems. Hence, my research ambition is to develop domain specfic ML algorithms for the data revolution in argrculture.  --->

Currently, most real-world applications are using machine learning (ML) techniques as **Maslow's hammer**;  problems are formulated into the form that existing ML methods can process. However, just like CNN is developed for computer vision, GNN is developed for social networks, the transformer is developed for NLP, etc., we need to design **task-specific ML algorithms** for each data science task. To do that, an ML system should be **data-centric**; we need to **program in terms of the data**:

> 1. **Decide assumption**: understand data sources and decide what assumptions should be made on the data --- *what's the experience?*
> 2. **Decide model graph**: based on the assumptions, think of what the model archetecture should be like --- *what's the DAG/functional form?*
> 3. **Decide learning ( & inference) process**: find an optimization solver --- *how to teach the experiences to the model?*
> 4. **Decide bussiness metric**: connect bussiness values to a metric and update the model iteratively.
> 5. **Deploy the model to production**

## My Background

</figure> 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the agricultural and biological engineering department at the University of Florida (UF) major in machine learning. I had two master's degrees in quantitative genetics and statistics both at UF. I enjoy reading machine learning books and learning about different machine learning areas in my spare time. I finished more than 10 books and several online courses during my Ph.D. program, so I have the fundamental knowledge across many machine learning areas, including *Bayesian graphical model, computer vision, natural language processing, graph neural network, ensemble methods, kernel machines, Bayesian deep learning, generative model (e.g. GAN, VAE, EBM, diffusion probabilistic models, and score-based generative modeling), reinforcement learning, causal inference, and meta-learning. However, textbooks are not enough because the field of AI is developing faster than ever; new methods can become outdated in a few months. Hence, I never stop catching up with the latest papers published in the top AI conferences. I find many of these papers can be well summarized in few sentences so I create this [60s-Paper](/portfolio/) module to help people get the principles of these papers fast. My solid statistical training enables me to gain a deep understanding of why and how machine learning works so I can precisely deploy AI solutions to various scenarios (see my [Projects](/projects/)).

Besides machine learning, I am passionate about real-world agricultural problems because it aims to solve basic human needs. Therefore, I am committed to contributing to the AI revolution of agricultural systems. My vision is to digitize agricultural problems and solve them with AI techniques. The AI revolution is an inevitable worldwide trend. However, the field of agriculture has not fully benefited from AI so far. Current agricultural AI applications are mostly classical statistical and machine learning decision-makers and other AI techniques, such as image recognition, that replace simple human labor. AI can do much more than that; AI is a general idea that formulates real-world problems to numerical representation that computers can process. My research's long-term goal is to use statistical AI techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, and their Bayesian version, to help with the decision support systems and other agriculture featured problems. 

I am looking for acedemy job opportunities where I can keep learning the cutting eadge techniques and deliver AI solutions to the argricalural problems. My goal is to boost the efficiency of agricultural systems with machine learning techniques. Therefore, those who spent their entire life fighting for a basic living will have the energy to explore their potential and make the world a better place. Feel free to [contact me](mailto: joshuahane@gmail.com) if you think I am suitable for your position. 


## My Research Interests

-**Machine learning techinques**: Uncertainty quantification, Bayesian deep learning, ensemble learning, zero-inflated modeling, anomally detection, generative models, computer vision (satellite image collections), and deploy these methods to argricultural problems.

-**Real-world issues**: I have experiences in water resource, sensor data, precipitation, animal behavior and quantitative genetic issues. 

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note:** Although I have hands on these issues only, the machine learning algorithms behind can easily translate to other domains as long as the problems are clearly set up.
