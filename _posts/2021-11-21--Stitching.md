## Paper
[Revisiting Model Stitching to Compare Neural Representations.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07682.pdf) [1]

## Main Message 
This paper provide quantitative evidence for emperical intuitations in building a deep neural network including:
- Why bottom represenations are reusable (i.e. transfer learning) across different tasks.
- Why "the more the better", i.e., lots of state-of-the-art results are achieved through bigger model, bigger data, and bigger training time.
